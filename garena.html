         The mode is played in a best-of-7 format, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 rounds.<br>
          Each round is won when all players from one team are killed, either by their opponents or through environmental factors. As of 2022, the maps used in Clash Squad are the same as those in Battle Royale mode. The mode can be played as either Ranked or Casual.<br>
